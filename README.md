# IBM Fetching Data from APIs
Created a React component named FetchData responsible for rendering fetched data onto the user interface. It uses the useFetch custom hook to retrieve data from an API endpoint specified by a URL.

The custom React hook named useFetch encapsulates the logic for fetching data from a specified URL. This hook uses useState and useEffect to manage the data fetching process, ensuring that data is retrieved asynchronously and stored in the component's state.
